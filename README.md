# Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of the Analysis  

In this module, we have been asked to evaluate and cluster all tradeable cryptocurrencies, using a dataset from CryptoCompare. The findings will be used to make a pitch to an investment bank to encourage new investments. We will use unsupervised machine learning to determine groupings and to create a classification system for all cryptocurrencies.  

Using Pandas, as well as the Scikit-learn, Plotly, and hvPlot libraries, we completed the following steps to support our analysis:  

- **Preprocessed** the dataset from CryptoCompare
- Reduced data dimensions using **principal component analysis (PCA)**
- Clustered cryptocurrencies using **K-means**
- **Visualized** the results using Plotly and hvPlot
